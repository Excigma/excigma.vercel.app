This the the repo containing the code for [a website containing some notes](https://excigma.vercel.app).
I was kinda bored that year and decided to take a dip in Next.js and React. Needless to say, the code quality is not the best.

Next.js's slow transpilation time along with the fact that I struggled to take notes fast enough in Markdown in class caused this project to kinda fade out.
