## Causes of Inflation
- Demand-pull
- - Demand has gone up significantly
- Cost-push
- - Prices go up due to less demand
- Quantity theory of money
- - $MV = PT$
- - Money supply x Income velocity = Price level x Real GDP

## Monetarist
Inflation is always is a monetary phenomenon
This theory is based on the quality theory of money (QTM).

$$
M * V = P * T
$$
Money supply * income velocity = Price level * Real GDP
V and T has overline (add later)

## Why is inflation bad?
1. Lowers the purchasing power of consumers
2. Inflation increases the nominal rate of interest
3. Loss in international competitiveness 
4. Debtors gain and creditors lowers


Inflation is far worse for the economy if it is a shock and therefore unanticipated.
If it is anticipated, then firms, workers, and the govt will adjust things accordingly

Wage-price spiral: Once inflation occurs, it starts a process that is difficult to stop.
- Nominal wages increase
- Cost of production increases, leading to cost pull inflation
- Price of final goods increases
- Increase in cost of living
- Trade Unions want a wage increase
