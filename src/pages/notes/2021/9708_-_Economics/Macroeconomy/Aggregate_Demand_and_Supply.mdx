## Aggregate Demand analysis

An increase or decrease in the price level will cause a moving along the curve, not a shift in the curve.

Aggregate demand is the Total demand for an economy at a given price level over time

AD = C + I + G + X - M

- C: Consumption
- I: Investment (Firms purchasing capital goods)
- G: Government spending (Roads, Housing, etc)
- X: Exports (exports to elsewhere, tourism)
- M: Imports

The largest component of aggregate demand is the spending of money on goods and services, also known as consumption. The most influential factor that may cause a change in consumer expenditure is probably a change in income.

Investment is the spending of money by firms to buy capital goods. This is also an important factor as not only does this increase the AD in the short run, it can help increase production of goods in the long run - if say new machinery is brought. Firms are influenced by their projection of future demand, a forecast increase in demand will cause them to buy new machinery to meet it.

Government expenditure or government spending is the money the government spends on goods and services to better the country by trying to provide improved infrastructure to promote growth and also by helping those in need.

Imports and exports are the goods and services we provide or purchase from other countries. Firms may buy goods and services from outside the country, leading to money leaving the country. On the contrary, goods can be exported internationally, causing firms to receive a profit from international firms or consumers.

- C + I = Private sector
- G = Public sector
- X + M = Foreign / International sector


## Why is the AD curve downward sloping?

as the Price level increases...


- Real income decrease
- Wealth effect, inflation
- Substitution of domestic goods away from international goods

## Aggregate Supply analysis



TODO: Add details

Supply-side policies. These are policies that lead to an increase in LRAS. These policies increase the quality and quality of factors of production and lead to an increase in the productive capacity of an economy



Increasing Land, Labour, Capital, or Enterprise.
