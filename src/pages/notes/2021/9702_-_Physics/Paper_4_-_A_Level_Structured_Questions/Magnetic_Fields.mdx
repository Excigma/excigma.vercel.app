## Magnetic fields in Magnets
- Field travels from South to North 
- Field travels South to North inside the magnetic
- Direction of field lines at any given point is equal to the direction of Force on magnetic north pole at that point

## Magnetics fields around a current carrying wire
Any current-carrying conductor will induce a radial magnetic field around it the direction found by the right hand grip rule
