## Magnetic fields in Magnets
- Field travels from South to North 
- Field travels South to North inside the magnetic
- Direction of field lines at any given point is equal to the direction of the force on the magnetic north pole at that point

## Magnetics fields around a current-carrying wire
Any current-carrying conductor will induce a radial magnetic field around it in the direction found by the right-hand grip rule

## Magnetic fields around and inside a solenoid
North pole = side which current is leaving
It is possible to use the right-hand grip rule: switch current and magnetic field, the thumb points in the direction of the north pole.

## Magnetic fields
A region of space where a magnetic pole experiences a force

## Force on current carrying conductor inside a magnetic field
Fleming's Left-hand rule
- Thumb: force
- 
 
or Right-hand slap rule
- Thumb: current
- Fingers: field lines
- Palm: force

When a current-carrying conductor $I$ of length $L$ is placed inside magnetic field $B$ at $90\degree$ it experiences a force $F$.

$$
F = BIL*sin(\theta)
$$

## Magnetic flux density
Force per unit length experienced by a long straight conductor carrying unit current and placed at right angles to the field at that point

## Tesla
One tesla is the uniform magnetic flux density when a wire carrying a current of 1.0A is placed at right angles to a magnetic field and experiences a force per unit length of 1.0N

## NMRI - Nuclear Magnetic resonance imaging

1. Quantum "spin" and magnetic moment of the proton

Particle nuclei (with differing numbers of protons and neutrons) have a quantum characteristic called spin.
... due to this spin, these nuclei have a magnetic moment

These magnetic moments allows these nuclei to interact with external magnetic fields
