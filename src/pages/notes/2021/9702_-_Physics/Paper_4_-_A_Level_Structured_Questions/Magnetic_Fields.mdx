## Magnetic fields in Magnets
- Field travels from South to North 
- Field travels South to North inside the magnetic
- Direction of field lines at any given point is equal to the direction of force on the magnetic north pole at that point

## Magnetics fields around a current-carrying wire
Any current-carrying conductor will induce a radial magnetic field around it in the direction found by the right-hand grip rule

## Magnetic fields around and inside a solenoid
North pole = side which current is leaving
It is possible to use the right-hand grip rule: switch current and magnetic field, the thumb points in the direction of the north pole.

## Magnetic fields
A region of space where a magnetic pole experiences a force
