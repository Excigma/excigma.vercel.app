## Newton's lawn of gravitation

Force between two point masses is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of their separation

$$
F_g = \frac{GMm}{r ^ 2}
$$

- $F_g$ Force due to gravitation (N)
- $G$ Gravitational constant $6.67*10^{-11}$
- $\text{ and } n$ Two pointer masses
- $r^2$ Separation of C.O.Ms

$F_g = mg$ is related to this formula: $g = \frac{GM}{r^2}$

## Gravitational field strength

The gravitational force exerted at a point per unit mass on a small test mass at that point

$$
g = \frac{GM}{r ^ 2}
$$

## Gravitational potential energy

Recall $\Delta{E_p} = mg\Delta{h}$ but now it's $g = \frac{GM}{r^2}$

$h = r$

$$
E_p = \frac{-GMm*h}{r^2} = \frac{-GMn}{r}
$$

Where did the negative come from?

Gravitational potential energy is defined as the work done in bringing a small test mass from infinity to that point


Maximum $E_p$ is at $r = \infty$ so at any $r$ less than $\infty$ there must be a smaller $E_p$. Since at $r = \infty$, $E_p = 0$, any smaller value must be negative


## Gravitational potential

The gravitational potential at a point is work done **per unit mass** in bringing a small test mass from infinity to that point


$$
\phi = \frac{-GM}{r}
$$
