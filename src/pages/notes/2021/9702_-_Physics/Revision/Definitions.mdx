## Radian 
> The angle subtended at the center of a circle of arc length equal to the radius of the circle

## Circular motion?

## Simple harmonic motion
$$
a = -x_0 w^2
$$
> A periodic motion caused by a linear rotating force and thus acceleration proportional to, but in the opposite direction to the displacement

## Damping
> Gradual loss in energy of an oscillating system
>> **Light damping:**
>> Resistive force enough to allow multiple oscillations

>> **Critical damping:**
>> Resistive force is just enough to allow that a damped system returns to equilibrium without oscillation

>> **Over-damping/Hard damping:**
>> Resistive force is so high it results in a slower return to the equilibrium position (Time taken to return > Period)

## Forced oscillation
> Forced oscillation occurs when a **periodic** force is applied to an oscillating system

## Resonance
> If the applied periodic force has a frequency equal to the **natural frequency ($f_0$)**
> Resonance results in a significant increase in the amplitude of oscillation

## Thermal equilibrium
> When two objects in contact with each other are at the same temperature, there will be **no net transfer** of **thermal energy** between them

## Celcius scale 
> Based on the thermal properties of water. It takes two fixed points; the melting point of pure ice and the boiling point of pure water and divides the range between into 100 equal increments

## Thermodynamic or Kelvin scale
> An absolute scale that does not depend on the physical properties of a particular substance, instead, it uses the **Average kinetic energy** of particles

## Thermistor 
> Semiconductor whose resistance **decreases** with **increasing** temperature

> Range: $-80\degree C \rarr 300\degree C$

## Thermocouple

## 1 Mole
> Amount of substance containing the same number of particles as there is in 12g of Carbon-12
> A mole of any substance contains a standard number of molecules given by Avogadro's Constant ($N_a$);
> $N_a = 6.02 * 10^23$

## Ideal gas
> RAVED
> - R: **Random** movement of particles in a gas
> - A: No intermonecular **attraction**
> - V: **Volume** of particles is neglectable compared to the total volume occupied by the gas
> - E: Collisions between molecules are **elastic**; no kinetic energy is lost
> - D: **Duration** of collisions is nill, collisions are instantanoues

## Boyle's Law
> The pressure exerted by a fixed mass of gas is inversely proportional to its volume, provided the temperature of the gas remains constant

## Charles' Law
> Temperature (Kelvin) is proportional to the volume of the gas

## Kinethic modal of gasses
> The kinetic model is a theory that links the microscopic particles to their macroscopic properties as a gas

## $First law of thermodynamics 
> Total internal energy is equal to the sum of total heat energy and total work done


## Adiabatic
> No thermal energy can leave or enter the system

## Isothermal
> Temperature remains constant

## Internal energy of a system
> The sum of the random distributions of kinetic and potential energies of molecules in a system

## Specific heat capacity
> quantity of thermal energy required to raise the temperature of a unit mass of the substance by 1 Kelvin

## Specific latent heat
> Thermal energy required per unit mass of a substance to change its state at a constant temperature
> Fusion = change to a lower energy state
> Vaporisation = change to a higher energy state

## Sensing device
> An electronic component with a property that changes when physical quantity such as light intensity changes

## Light-dependant resistor
> An LDR is made of high resistance semi-conducting metal

## Piezo-electric transducer 
> Some crystals such as quartz produce a force when a potential difference is applied across them, causing their shape to change. This is known as the piezo-electric effect.

## Acoustic impedance
> Product of the density of a medium and the velocity of waves traveling through that medium

## Attenuation
> Progressive reduction of power/energy of a wave with distance as it travels along a transmission path through a medium

## Ideal Op-amp
> - **Infinite input impedance:** No current in and out through inputs
> - **Zero output impedance:** Entire $V_\text{out}$ is distributed across load
> - **Infinite open-loop gain:** Output is immediately saturated
> - **Infinite bandwidth:** All frequencies across inputs are amplified evenly
> - **Infinite slew rate:** Any change in input results in an instant change across inputs (aka No latency, but do not write this)

## Feedback loops
> - **Increases bandwidth**
> - **Descrease distortion**
> - **Greater operational stability**
> - **Reduce effective gain (...to avoid saturation)**

## Negative Feedback
> When some of the output is fed back into the inverting input of an op-amp to minimize saturation

## Carrier wave
> A Carrier wave is a high-frequency Electromagnetic wave modulated in either frequency or amplitude to transfer a signal

## Amplitude Modulation
>In amplitude modulation (AM) the frequency of the modulated wave is constant, and the amplitude of the modulated wave varies proportionally to and in phase with the signal

## Frequency Modulation
> In frequency modulation (FM), the amplitude of the carrier wave remains constant. The frequency of the carrier wave is made to vary in sync with the displacement of this information signal

## Bandwidth (Communication)
> The range of frequencies occupied by the amplitude-modulated wave

## Noise
> Random unwanted signal that is added onto and distorts the transmitted signal

## Analog signal
> Signal has the same variation as the data and is **continuously variable**

## Digital signal
> Signal with only high and low states with no intermediate values - discrete. Due to this, repeaters can regenerate a signal matching the original one without the noise.

## ADC - Analog to digital converter
> Samples an input analog signal at the sampling rate and outputs the voltage of the analog signal at that time

## Sampling
> Take analog signal and "sample" its voltage at regular intervals called the sampling rate

## Wire pairs
> Potential difference between the two wires carries the signal

## Wire pairs
> Potential difference between the two wires is the signal

## Coaxial cable
> Copper core with insulation and copper sheath/braid around outside shields core from noise.

## Signal to noise ratio
> A signal must be distinguishable from noise, this can be measured using the signal to noise ratio. 
> Repeaters amplify both the signal and noise, so do not affect SNR
> Signal regenerators completely regenerate the original signal, so that noise is removed.

## Geostationary satellite
> The satellite stays in a fixed position on top of earth above the equator and orbits from west-to-east with a period of 24 hours

## Newton's law of gravitation
