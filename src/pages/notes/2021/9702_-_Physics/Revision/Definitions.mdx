## Radian 
> The angle subtended at the center of a circle of arc length equal to the radius of the circle

## Circular motion?

## Simple harmonic motion
$$
a = -x_0 w^2
$$
> A periodic motion caused by a linear rotating force and thus acceleration proportional to, but in the opposite direction to the displacement

## Damping
> Gradual loss in energy of an oscillating system
>> **Light damping:**
>> Resistive force enough to allow multiple oscillations

>> **Critical damping:**
>> Resistive force is just enough to allow that a damped system returns to equilibrium without oscillation

>> **Over-damping/Hard damping:**
>> Resistive force is so high it results in a slower return to the equilibrium position (Time taken to return > Period)

## Forced oscillation
> Forced oscillation occurs when a **periodic** force is applied to an oscillating system

## Resonance
> If the applied periodic force has a frequency equal to the **natural frequency ($f_0$)**
> Resonance results in a significant increase in the amplitude of oscillation

## Thermal equilibrium
> When two objects in contact with each other are at the same temperature, there will be **no net transfer** of **thermal energy** between them

## Celcius scale 
> Based on the thermal properties of water. It takes two fixed points; the melting point of pure ice and the boiling point of pure water and divides the range between into 100 equal increments

## Thermodynamic or Kelvin scale
> An absolute scale that does not depend on the physical properties of a particular substance, instead, it uses the **Average kinetic energy** of particles

## Thermistor 
> Semiconductor whose resistance **decreases** with **increasing** temperature

> Range: $-80\degree C \rarr 300\degree C$

## Thermocouple
> Use a potential difference between two different metals to produce a temperate reading

> Range: $-200\degree C \rarr 1800\degree C$

## Resistive Wire
> Measure resistance of the wire to determine temperature.

> Range: $-260\degree C \rarr 850\degree C$

## 1 Mole
> Amount of substance containing the same number of particles as there is in 12g of Carbon-12
> A mole of any substance contains a standard number of molecules given by Avogadro's Constant ($N_a$);
> $N_a = 6.02 * 10^23$

## Ideal gas
> RAVED
> - R: **Random** movement of particles in a gas
> - A: No intermonecular **attraction**
> - V: **Volume** of particles is neglectable compared to the total volume occupied by the gas
> - E: Collisions between molecules are **elastic**; no kinetic energy is lost
> - D: **Duration** of collisions is nill, collisions are instantanoues

## Boyle's Law
> The pressure exerted by a fixed mass of gas is inversely proportional to its volume, provided the temperature of the gas remains constant

## Charles' Law
> Temperature (Kelvin) is proportional to the volume of the gas

## Kinethic modal of gasses
> The kinetic model is a theory that links the microscopic particles to their macroscopic properties as a gas

## $First law of thermodynamics 
> Total internal energy is equal to the sum of total heat energy and total work done


## Adiabatic
> No thermal energy can leave or enter the system

## Isothermal
> Temperature remains constant

## Internal energy of a system
> The sum of the random distributions of kinetic and potential energies of monecules in a system

## Specific heat capacity
> quantity of thermal energy required to raise the temperature of a unit mass of the substance by 1 Kelvin

## Specific latent heat
> Thermal energy required per unit mass of a substance to change its state at a constant temperature
> Fusion = change to a lower energy state
> Vaporisation = change to a higher energy state
